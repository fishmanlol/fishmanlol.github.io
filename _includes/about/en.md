Hey, everyone! I'm Werur, I love Dota and Coffee.

I'd love to share knowledge, but writing is not my favor. This is my first attempt.

I try to explain every detail in my articles, it's also a shortcut for me to understand it well.

Behind the iOS development, reverse engineering makes me dive into the core of programming. I will record my expierence in learning it. Being a cool hacker is one of my initial powers that drive me to major in Computer Science.
